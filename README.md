# Pave-Wise AI: Smart Road Damage Reporting and Management System

Pave-Wise AI is an **AI-enabled Smart Road Damage Reporting and Management System** designed for **Solapur Municipal Corporation (SMC)**. The platform empowers citizens to report road issues in real-time and equips SMC officials with tools for **verification, prioritization, resource allocation, monitoring, and rapid resolution**.

## Problem Statement

Design and develop an AI-enabled system for **real-time reporting and management of road damage in Solapur city**, addressing the challenges faced by citizens and municipal officials in detecting, reporting, and resolving road infrastructure issues.

---

## Context

Solapur city frequently experiences road damage such as potholes, cracks, and surface failures due to:

- Heavy monsoons
- Ongoing construction activities
- Underground utility works
- High traffic loads

These damages:

- Pose safety risks to citizens
- Disrupt traffic movement
- Lead to public dissatisfaction  

Currently, **SMC lacks a centralized, real-time, technology-driven platform** for systematic reporting, verification, prioritization, and monitoring of road damage complaints across departments.

---

## Problem Description

### 1. Efficient Detection and Reporting of Road Damage
- Citizens face difficulty in reporting potholes and road damage through existing mechanisms.
- Lack of geo-tagged, time-stamped, and visual evidence-based reporting.
- Delays in verification and response due to fragmented communication.

### 2. Multi-Departmental Coordination
Road damage may occur due to:  

- Heavy rainfall and flooding  
- Construction and excavation activities  
- Underground utility repairs (water supply, drainage, electricity, telecom)  
- Poor construction quality  
- Heavy vehicular load  

**Challenges:** Multiple departments (Engineering, Ward Offices, Traffic, Disaster Management) are involved, but **no unified digital workflow** exists for coordination and accountability.

### 3. Real-Time Monitoring and Accountability
- Citizens do not receive timely updates on complaint status.
- Officials lack centralized dashboards for tracking resolution timelines and contractor performance.
- Manual, paper-based processes reduce transparency and efficiency.

---

## Features

- **Citizen Reporting:** Easy, real-time reporting with geo-tagging, photos, and timestamps.  
- **Dashboard for Officials:** Track complaints, verify issues, prioritize work, allocate resources.  
- **AI Assistance:** Analyze reports, detect patterns, and suggest prioritization.  
- **Multi-Department Coordination:** Centralized workflow connecting all relevant municipal departments.  
- **Monitoring & Accountability:** Track status updates, timelines, and performance metrics.

## Technologies Used

- [Lovable](https://lovable.app) – No-code web app builder  
- AI models for smart issue detection (integrated via Lovable platform)
